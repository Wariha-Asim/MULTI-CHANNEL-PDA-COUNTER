# 🧮 Multi-Channel PDA Counter (Tkinter)

A simple GUI project that simulates a **PDA-style counter system** for multiple channels (A, B, C).  
Each channel has its own **count, stack, and state**, and the app visually shows how values change when inputs are processed.

This project is built using **Python + Tkinter** and is great for learning:

- Pushdown Automata concepts (stack, states)
- Object-Oriented Programming (classes & objects)
- GUI programming
- Dictionaries & dictionary comprehension

---

## 🚀 Features

✔️ Three independent channels: **A, B, C**  
✔️ Each channel tracks:

- Count  
- Stack  
- Current State  
- Last Input  

✔️ Buttons to simulate PDA operations  
✔️ Clear, reset, and switching between channels  
✔️ Beginner-friendly structure

## 🧠 PDA Concept (Short Explanation)

This project behaves like a **Pushdown Automaton (PDA)**:

- The **stack** stores symbols  
- The **state** changes based on input  
- Operations can **push or pop** from the stack  
- Each channel acts like its **own PDA**

main.py → GUI + main logic
channels_state.json → Saves channel data (counts, stacks, states, last input)

1️⃣ Install Python (if not installed)  
2️⃣ Run the program:
